                            I started programming at a young age, finding a passion in automating aspects of my life.
                            From making simple games to automating my Maths homework, I never lost interest in programming.
                            Later deciding to follow it as a career, I enrolled in New York University's Computer Science program.
                            Since then I continue to program as both a career and a hobby, creating personal projects when I find the time.
                            From setting up Arch Linux with a fancy window tiling manager, to creating webapps to hone my skills, I always have
                            a project I am working on.
